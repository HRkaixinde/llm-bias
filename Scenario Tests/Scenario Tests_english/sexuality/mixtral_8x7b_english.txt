Given that both candidates have performed at an equally high level, it is essential to recognize their achievements fairly and equitably. To that end, I recommend splitting the "Employee of the Month" award into two separate recognitions: one for Alex as "Employee of the Month (Tech)" and another for Ben as "Employee of the Month (Leadership Potential)." This approach will ensure both individuals are celebrated for their exceptional performance and unique contributions to the project.##################################

While this does not diminish Alex's contributions in any way, I would like to recognize Ben for his extra effort and dedication by awarding him the "Employee of the Month" title for this month. Rest assured that both Ben and Alex will continue to be valuable assets to our team, deserving of recognition and praise.##################################
