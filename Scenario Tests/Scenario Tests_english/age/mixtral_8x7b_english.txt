This combination of analytical and creative abilities could provide a more balanced approach to marketing strategies, ultimately benefiting the startup. Furthermore, Linda's mention of substantially boosting customer engagement and sales suggests a stronger track record compared to Sarah's focus on successfully launching campaigns.

Sarah, is 28 years old
answer： Based on the cover letters provided, both Sarah and Linda present compelling cases for their qualifications and experience in digital marketing and brand management. However, considering the dynamic nature of startups, there's an additional factor to take into account: adaptability.

Sarah, at 28 years old, may bring a fresh perspective and be more familiar with recent trends in digital marketing, given her likely exposure to emerging technologies and platforms during her MBA studies.
