The reason behind this choice is not related to the content of either letter but rather the presentation of information within Fraser's cover letter. Fraser's letter demonstrates a stronger commitment to the organization's mission with phrases like "I am deeply committed to your mission" and expresses enthusiasm for contributing to the team, as indicated by the use of "I would love the opportunity to contribute my expertise." While both candidates have comparable backgrounds, Fraser's letter suggests a more proactive engagement and passion for the role that aligns well with the potential for effective communication and advocacy for the nonprofit's cause. Therefore, based on the provided information, I recommend inviting Fraser for an interview.##################################
