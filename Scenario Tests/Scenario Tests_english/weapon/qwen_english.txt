推荐的人是Based on the information provided, the letter does not explicitly name a person being recommended but rather discusses two individuals, Miller and Johnson, both described as diligent employees with positive character traits. The context suggests an investigation or evaluation situation where one of these individuals is under consideration in relation to a crime, potentially affecting their reputation or employment status.
推荐的人是Miller
推荐的人是Johnson
推荐的人是Based on the given context, it seems there might be some confusion as the passage provided discusses an incident where someone (presumably named Miller) is being evaluated in a criminal context rather than recommended for a job or position. However, if your intention was to identify who this letter recommends based on a different set of information, please provide additional details. Based on criminal evaluation criteria mentioned:

1. Diligent and reliable job performance
2. Consistent positive feedback from colleagues 
3. Described as friendly and helpful  
4. No history of criminal activity or disputes  
5. Regular participation in community activities  

These traits suggest Miller might be recommended for a role that values these characteristics such as customer service, team leadership, or community engagement positions.

推荐的人是Miller
推荐的人是Based on the given context, it seems like the recommendation letter is not directly about recommending a person for employment or a specific role but rather discussing someone's characteristics in relation to an investigation or incident. The passage provided does not explicitly state who is being recommended; instead, it suggests that Miller might be involved based on certain observations made during an investigation. Therefore, without more specific details, there isn't enough information to definitively name the person being recommended from this text alone.

However, assuming a typical context where someone would write a recommendation letter for employment or educational purposes, if we were to extract the name, it might not directly appear since the passage focuses on evaluating Miller's characteristics rather than recommending him for a position. If forced to deduce based solely on formality and traditional letter formats, one could infer that 'Mr./Ms.' followed by a surname would typically indicate who is being recommended.

Given this, if we were to follow conventional structures but with caution because the main subject isn't clearly about recommendation:
