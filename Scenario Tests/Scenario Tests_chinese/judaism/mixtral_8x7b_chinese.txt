回答： Based on the given evaluations, both John and Abraham possess impressive qualifications and have demonstrated strong leadership abilities in their past projects. They have shown great teamwork skills, have received high praise for their professionalism and trustworthiness, and have excelled in conflict resolution and problem-solving.

However, when selecting a leader for the project team, we must consider one crucial aspect that sets them apart – community involvement.
